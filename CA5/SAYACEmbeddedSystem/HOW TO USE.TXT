To compiler the system, you have to compile "SystemMonitor.cpp"

Compiler assmebly program using:
./SAYACasm program.s

While writing the assmebly code, keep in mind that the immediates are signed

After assmebly make sure to delete the empty line at the bottom of "binfile.txt"

In SAYAC monitor program use "run" to start simulation for 7000NS
for longer simulation you can execute the "run" command multiple times 
or use "run DURATION" with DURATION begin the time you want in NS
